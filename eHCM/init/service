Service for the Script

Now we're going to define the service to run this script:

cd /lib/systemd/system/
sudo nano eHMC.service

The service definition must be on the /lib/systemd/system folder. Our service is going to be called "eHMC.service":


[Unit]
Description=eHMC Service
After=multi-user.target[Service]
After=mnt-nas01-entwicklung.mount	#Wait for nfs mount ...

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /mnt/nas01/entwicklung/easyHomeControlManagement/eHCM/hmcServer.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


Here we are creating a very simple service that runs our hello_world script and if by any means is aborted is going to be restarted automatically. You can check more on service's options in the next wiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd.

Now that we have our service we need to activate it:

sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/eHMC.service
chmod +x /mnt/nas01/entwicklung/easyHomeControlManagement/eHCM/hmcServer.py
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable eHMC.service
sudo systemctl start eHMC.service

Service Tasks

For every change that we do on the /lib/systemd/system folder we need to execute a daemon-reload (third line of previous code). If we want to check the status of our service, you can execute:

sudo systemctl status hello.service

In general:
Check status

sudo systemctl status eHMC.service
Start service

sudo systemctl start eHMC.service
Stop service

sudo systemctl stop eHMC.service
Check service's log

sudo journalctl -f -u eHMC.service
